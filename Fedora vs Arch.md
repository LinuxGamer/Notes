# Fedora vs Arch

## Arch Positives & Negatives

### Positives

- AUR - good for finding precompiled software (that otherwise would need to be compiled yourself)

- Rolling release - newest packages

### Negatives

- Newest packages - can break things

- I've had a few crashes on Arch which I never experienced whilst on Fedora.

## Fedora Positives & Negatives

### Positives

- Stable (6 month) release cycle.

- Flatpaks - good containerised apps (like AUR).

### Negatives

* Slightly older packages (but still pretty up to date)

## Uses

- School - coursework, notes, etc

- Coding - small personal projects, larger professional projects (website, Artsly, Dotto)

-
